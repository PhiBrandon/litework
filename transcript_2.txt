there is actually massive news today unironically a big news day because this morning the Activision Blizzard by has officially happened Xbox made a trailer today talking about it let's watch the trailer you guys [Music] ready [Music] bright there's a bright golden Haze on the SS of the Earth are like music Duty sounds of the earth [Music] Sim 

OverWatch Fallout Starfield is home now home family that's cute this is pretty good we need an army I can get us an [Music] army it's about [Music] ter we're a team all of us no one fights alone I'll follow you from here on [Music] [Applause] [Music] Earth I forgot about remember Gears of War thought Microsoft forgot about 

them it's a good day to play remember yeah remember them man I was actually pretty good better than I would have expected today the actual buyout of Activision Blizzard King for I think it was 69 I'm not even kidding billion dollar happened they put out a statement and everything about it and on top of that for now 

nothing changes however uh this is reported by Jason Trier as the Microsoft Activision deal closes Bobby [ __ ] dick says that he will stay on as CEO through the end of the year on January 1st 2024 he will depart the company he took over 33 years ago a massive change for the video game industry so there is uh 

it's looking like Bobby kodic is actually I I've got a I have to tell you guys I really don't think this is his final form I don't think he's just going to retire I I really I don't think I don't think it's going to happen right I think like I don't know is he going to run for 

president like is he going to [ __ ] like try to take over something else like yeah I don't think I don't know man I really don't so yeah he's going to go work at Unity now actually that makes a lot of sense now yeah true uh they just got rid of the other guy and uh anyway so it's 

looking like Bobby codic is going to be out at some point I mean oh my God uh I'm not really surprised by this I think that often times you have you know senior leadership change UPS whenever you have a big company like this that gets bought out especially if it's like the CEO Etc so it kind of 

makes sense but um yeah I mean I uh I'm pretty surprised to see the whole thing happen like I I kind of expected it to happen I did however it happening oh that's something different isn't it so yeah it's looking like uh it's looking like we're all Xbox Microsoft Gamers now what do you think this means for 

Sony um it probably means that they're still going to have better exclusives on Console um besides that I don't know I have no idea uh please don't let him screw this up Sony and shambles well I mean I don't know I mean look at Nintendo I mean [ __ ] Nintendo's a bigger Monopoly almost neither one of them so 

like not not in terms of like the size of the company but in terms of like you know what they have control over uh it's like no Nintendo games hardly are on PC or any other platform right Nintendo does their own thing completely yeah they're in their own league so I really really hope that uh wow goes 

on Game Pass because if wow goes on Game Pass that's going to bring in so many new players to the game because now they can actually get other value with the game and there will be people that will come in and then leave the game and then not unsub because they have Game Pass and like the ease 

like the biggest barrier to entry for wow is the fact that you have to spend $15 a month in order to play the game you do you have to spend $15 a month and it's like okay well what if I don't like the game what if I'm only going to play it for one day what if I 

don't know so having it on Game Pass makes it to where people can effectively hedge their bets like oh it's on Game Pass it's not a big deal if you know like the game isn't that great because at least I can go and play other games and I'm still getting something out of it right and you also 

have the existing Game Pass Andes that are using it and now they're like oh well I can just play WoW for free okay I guess I'll try it out so yes this is a huge massive thing and I do think that if wow goes on The Game Pass we can look at a very bright future for World 

of Warcraft if wow doesn't go on game pass we'll have to see what happens but I do think that it going on Game Pass is like that means that Microsoft is investing a tremendous amount of value into it won't bers lose money if it goes to Game Pass exactly they will and that's why that's why so if 

they're losing money because it goes on The Game Pass they don't lose money when it goes on The Game Pass what that means is that they're going to be using it as what's called it's like in stores right they're called Lost leaders where you have like something that's attached to like a bundle of products that is like 

the main reason why people buy something like for example how many of you guys subscribed to HBO go whenever Game of Thrones was happening or how many of you guys subscribed to um uh whatever like it is for like uh the Mandalorian right so and and that's that's the loss leader right it it gives it the higher 

value now would people buy that individually yes they would but if you can bundle it with other things you're going to have a number of the people that you know they watch Game of Thrones and maybe they keep their subscription accidentally right or maybe they um maybe they watch other shows as well and that's how it happens 

and in stores like for example Black Friday they do sell $100 TVs on Black Friday however that's not the majority of the sales those are the sales that are the ones they can put on the front page and say oh my god get the [ __ ] in here right now you need to get this they're probably losing money 

on those televisions but they know that once they get somebody in the store there's a higher chance that that person is going to be willing to buy something else and that's the point that I'm making I'd rather them read through the game and then put on Microsoft Game Pass so I'm not sure like Costco chicken yes uh 

uh Costco hot dogs chicken um Sam's Club Pizza stuff like that yes it gets people in the store and then and I think they still probably make money off of it but it's like nothing but anyway uh it gets people in the store and then whenever they're in the store then they buy the chair that's $200 so 

yes this is a huge thing and that's what I was saying that if if if Microsoft is willing to put uh World of Warcraft on the game pass it means that they have so much confidence in it that they are willing to lose the money that they will inevitably lose from like wow Subs to like transitioning them 

to Game Pass Subs because they think that it will be such an inducement of value that it will bring in more people overall so yes um this is a it's a huge thing that bring better value then so like let me let me go ahead and explain why this is why I hope they do [Music] this in 

this circumstance you would lose the money in the red but you would gain the value in the green now the problem with this is that value is not quantifiable in the same way that losing money is quantifiable like you can gain a theoretical this many people or that many people but it's very different than if you say 

we're going to lose $5 million so yes they will lose this money but the logic is that in losing this money that value goes over to these other two sides and in doing so it will cause people to maintain the subscriptions longer that will subsidize the loss of this money and then some that is the logic you 

understand how it works it's uh just it's pretty simple economics once you once you think about it uh you know that's about it Phil Spencer is old school Gamer does this bode well for Classic Plus in your opinion uh yeah I think this bode's well for blizzard in general uh I think that like I'm not the only 

person who feels this way um blizzard has been in need of a shakeup for like 10 years I think that everything that they've been making besides uh maybe like one or two things has been incredibly boring uh there's nothing with like Edge to it there's nothing that's like uh uh it's not it doesn't have any grit to 

it it doesn't have any excitement like you don't think about it whenever you finish it you just play it and forget it's stale yeah it's got no girth yeah there you go exactly uh maybe Unity will want to to see that good one yeah uh Bobby was got to shareholders to the end dude somehow got Microsoft to 

buy his company now he's just walking off into the sunset as I said guys I really don't think this is Bobby kodak's final form I I don't know uh we'll have to see what happens I think that what's either going to happen is that Bobby kodic will take on a separate leadership r at uh Microsoft at overseeing 

their gaming stuff or um he will do something that's related to a metaverse uh he's talked about that in almost every interview he's been in so and I've I've seen a number of them uh I think that's probably what's going to happen yeah so Bobby will literally be your new God in like 15 years whenever the metaverse 

is like a legit thing yes Bobby will be God it's the Bobby verse that's right in those 33 years he exponentially boosted both companies Revenue managed to hide atrocities in the office for the better interest of the company and even after exposure somehow convinced Microsoft to fish them out for a sizable chunk of change for a business 

sense I think that he actually deserves a massive Applause I can't wait for you to read this and get mad not because you disagree but because you know it is true it's Bobby's World there it is it is amazing he did it yes he actually [ __ ] did it despite all the odds everything stacked against him the entire 

world against him Bobby is riding off into the sunset with close to a billion well I think no probably another billion dollars and to think that people really thought that he wasn't the main character oh my God Bobby is the LeBron of gaming I don't know what he is man you got to give it to the man 

yeah holy [ __ ] knows how to makes employees work through lunch it will not happen because the token becomes useless oh the wow token oh that's a very good point I think we could see them redesign finding the payment structure for a while fundamentally I think they have to yeah I I really think so we be living as 

Bobby's World nameless NPC yeah exactly yeah man uh it's just holy [ __ ] it's not Bobby's World yeah Bobby won holy [ __ ] yeah it's like whenever yeah it's like whenever you really put it into perspective oh my [Music] God Jesus man Bobby's on New Game Plus yeah we won to though yeah that's the best part is that Bobby 

walks away with a massive bag no nobody likes Bobby but nobody's complaining it's actually the best ending of the story that the villain of the story somehow delivers salvation in a way that nobody really wanted or expected and nobody can really complain about it but everybody is like sitting there a son of a [ __ ] you know and 

he drives off into the horizon or sorry sails off into the Horizon on his yacht with a helipad on it he's the hero nobody wants that's right it's actually a really good story whenever you think about it holy [ __ ] coming out with a popped yeah Bobby with the popped collar man isn't he alone and old yeah but 

he's got kids right I mean so he's not I mean he's not never really alone he's he's got kids and it's whatever and I'm sure yeah Bobby said and this is the thing right is he was complaining about this he said that he couldn't go out on dates with girls because he would go out on a date 

with this chick and everything was going really well and they'd plan a second date and then she'd go home and look him up and then that was it yep and so and he was complaining about this he's like this is he's like guys y'all have to stop writing these [ __ ] articles like this is this is really [ __ ] 

with my life please stop it ban me in a year if Bobby won't get his own Netflix show about his life yeah I know man now d da in wrong women just get it a gold digger and doesn't care I mean who knows I'm not I'm not involved with Bobby's love I don't what the [ __ ] do I 

know but like all I'm saying is that's what he said but yes it looks like at least until then Bobby will stay on his CEO and again I really really really just don't think this is Bobby's final form and to be honest with you I kind of hope it's not because it's been very entertaining so far and 

yes we are all Microsoft Gamers the uh merger has gone or not merger the uh the the acquisition has gone over and gone through Microsoft now owns Activision Blizzard King one of the biggest gaming Acquisitions of all time happened today who was here well we all were isn't that crazy isn't that [ __ ] crazy this kind of a 

big deal yeah it's actually yeah so so now that we're Microsoft Gamers do we have to defend Starfield look look there are limits to everything okay Starfield yeah yeah Starfield is not really that bad of a game okay like it's a really good game if you don't play it the best way to play Starfield and enjoy it 

is to not play it that's that's the that's what you've got to do just don't play the game and you're going to be totally fine hope he goes to EA they seem like a match made in hell yeah exactly uh Le Bobby will live inside all of us he's departing the company yep there we go long live 

the king there it is Xbox game pass ultimate $17 a month Xbox game pass is unironically probably the best value thing that you can do right now for games I think that Phil Spencer should pay me every single time I say that but it is unironically one of the best value things that you can ever do with 

your money it is $17 a month and if you play video games even a little bit you will probably never run out of games to play there are multiple massive AAA games on Game Pass I would 100% recommend it so yes
